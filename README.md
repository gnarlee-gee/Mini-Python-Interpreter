# Description  
  
A program that evaluates simple list expressions. Input source code will be python code and interpreted in C++. The program uses regular expressions to recognize identifiers, numbers, and strings. *__This was a class project where we had partners. I will label my contributions throughout the program, above functions, using comments.__* I contributed by using regular expressions to recognize: list assignments, variable assignments, and if/else statements.  

# Run Program
